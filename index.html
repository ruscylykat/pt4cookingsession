                <p>Chicken Pastil is a Filipino Muslim recipe that is served with steamed rice topped with shredded chicken. It is introduced from a Muslim region of Mindanao which is a popular breakfast meal.</p>

                <p>Pastil; also called Patel, Patil, or Pater in Muslim Mindanao is made with steam rice topped with shredded meat.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The shredded meat could either be chicken, beef, or fish, which they call kagikit. To make the meat, it is sauteed in vegetable oil with onion, garlic, and soy sauce until it turns brown.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Traditionally, they wrapped the rice and the meat in banana leaves to help absorb the flavor. But in my Chicken Pastil recipe, I will not be using any leaves since I am cooking and serving this at the same time.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Banana leaves are usually used when you sell in the food stalls, bring them to your workplace, or anywhere you go.</p>
